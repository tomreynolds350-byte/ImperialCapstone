# My Writing Tone – Tom Reynolds

## 1. Overall tone

- Professional and technically authoritative, but not stiff. [file:4]
- Subject‑matter expert speaking to peers and stakeholders.
- Measured and calm even when raising issues: problems are flagged in a fact‑based way.
- Mix formal business tone with light, human touches:
  - “Nice to meet you.”
  - “Happy to have a quick call.”
  - Phrases like “the programme grew arms and legs.”

## 2. Sentence structure

- Predominantly medium‑to‑long, information‑dense sentences, often with multiple clauses and clarifications.
- Frequent use of colons and lists to structure complex ideas.
- Occasional short, punchy sentences for emphasis or summary.
- Regular use of parentheses and abbreviations for precision.

## 3. Word choice

- Mix of technical and commercial language:  
  e.g. BMU registration, Optimisation Agreement, FFR auctions, Capacity Market, opportunity costs.
- Comfortable with acronyms, but often anchored with a concise explanation when needed.
- Vocabulary is sophisticated but in plain English where possible, with clear explanation of mechanisms.
- Occasional conversational/British phrasing:
  - “Flat out on the tender.”
  - “Development is messy.”
  - “Grew arms and legs.”

## 4. Personality and stance

- Pragmatic, analytical, and improvement‑oriented.
- Focused on process optimisation, often tying points to money and risk (e.g. “5–10k per day is being sacrificed”).
- Commercially sharp and outcome‑focused.
- Candid but fair about people and organisations.
- Reflective and self‑aware when writing about personal context.

## 5. Common patterns

- Lead with context, then move to implications, then specific asks or recommendations.
- Frequent use of connectors such as “therefore”, “in order to”, “what it means is”.
- Use of concrete examples and scenarios rather than abstract statements.
- Habit of inviting follow‑up conversation rather than closing things down:
  - “Happy to have a quick call if you want to discuss.”
  - “If you have time for a quick call I can explain this further.”

## 6. Distinctive features

- Strong blend of technical detail, commercial impact, and operational realism.
- Clear systems‑thinking: end‑to‑end processes rather than isolated tasks.
- Tendency to translate complexity into linear, step‑by‑step explanations.
- Characteristic mix of formality and grounded, conversational phrasing that gives a human, experienced‑operator feel.
